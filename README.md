## Description

A JavaScript app that allows a user to view doctors in the Portland area that meet the user's search criteria by utilizing the BetterDoctor API.

## User Stories

* As a user, I should be able to enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit my search query.
* As a user, I should be able to enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit my search query.
* As a user, if the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients.
* As a user, if the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is so that I know an error has occurred.
* As a user, if the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet my search criteria.
